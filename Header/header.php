Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the world&rsquo;s largest professional association dedicated to advancing technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. We at BVPIEEE have always promoted IEEE as a common platform to share knowledge through interactive sessions, seminars, field trips, conferences and have stayed true to the essence of IEEE. Our aim is to create a talent pool where students interact and exchange ideas, network with people from various institutions and disciplines, and most importantly, learn in the process.</p>
